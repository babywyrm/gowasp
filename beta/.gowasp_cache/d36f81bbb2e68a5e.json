  "raw_response": "# Security Deep Dive: Dependency and Configuration Analysis Report\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOur comprehensive security analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities across authentication, configuration management, and system exposure vectors. The application exhibits systemic security weaknesses that present significant business risks, including potential unauthorized access, sensitive information disclosure, and increased attack surface. These findings demand immediate, prioritized remediation to prevent potential security breaches and protect organizational assets.\n\n## Key Patterns & Root Causes\n\n1. **Credential and Sensitive Data Exposure**\n   - Multiple instances of hardcoded credentials in source code\n   - Direct exposure of API keys, tokens, and environment configurations\n   - Risks include potential unauthorized system access and data compromise\n\n2. **Inadequate Authentication and Authorization Controls**\n   - Weak authentication mechanisms with no multi-factor authentication\n   - Use of NoOp password encoders (plain text passwords)\n   - Overly permissive endpoint and repository configurations\n   - High potential for unauthorized system access and data manipulation\n\n3. **Configuration and Security Misconfiguration**\n   - Disabled security protections (CSRF, HTTP security headers)\n   - Exposed management and actuator endpoints\n   - Unsecured configuration endpoints\n   - Increases system vulnerability and potential attack vectors\n\n4. **Improper Resource and Dependency Management**\n   - Unsafe resource location configurations\n   - Potential dependency vulnerabilities\n   - Direct database connection without proper sanitization\n   - Risks include potential injection attacks and information disclosure\n\n## Prioritized Action Plan\n\n1. **Immediate Credential Removal** (Highest Priority)\n   - Remove all hardcoded credentials from `ActuatorExposureTask.java`, `DefaultCredentialsTask.java`, `VerboseErrorTask.java`\n   - Implement secure credential management using environment variables or secure vault\n   - Use strong, randomly generated credentials\n\n2. **Authentication Mechanism Hardening**\n   - Replace `NoOpPasswordEncoder` in `WebSecurityConfig.java`\n   - Implement strong password hashing (bcrypt/PBKDF2)\n   - Add multi-factor authentication\n   - Enforce strong password policies\n\n3. **Secure Configuration Management**\n   - Disable/restrict actuator endpoints in `ActuatorExposureTask.java`\n   - Implement proper authentication for management interfaces\n   - Remove detailed error and environment exposures\n   - Add strict configuration validation in `ConfigHardeningTask.java`\n\n4. **Security Header and CSRF Protection**\n   - Re-enable CSRF protection in `WebSecurityConfig.java`\n   - Configure robust HTTP security headers\n   - Implement proper CORS configurations\n\n5. **Repository and Database Security**\n   - Add input validation in `UserRepository.java`\n   - Implement query sanitization\n   - Add authentication checks for repository methods\n   - Secure database connection in `DatabaseConfiguration.java`\n\n6. **Resource and Endpoint Protection**\n   - Restrict resource handlers in `MvcConfiguration.java`\n   - Add proper authentication for all endpoints\n   - Implement strict input validation\n   - Remove unnecessary public configurations\n\n7. **Dependency and Vulnerability Management**\n   - Conduct thorough dependency vulnerability scan\n   - Update all third-party libraries\n   - Implement continuous security monitoring\n   - Add SAST/DAST tools to CI/CD pipeline\n\n8. **Comprehensive Security Audit**\n   - Perform full security review of `SecurityMisconfiguration.java`\n   - Add explicit security controls to all Spring components\n   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)",
