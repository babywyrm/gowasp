  "raw_response": "# Security Architecture Assessment Report\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe codebase exhibits widespread security vulnerabilities that pose significant business risks, particularly around authentication, file handling, and access control. Most critically, the application's security configuration is severely misconfigured, with disabled CSRF protection, plaintext password storage, and unrestricted file operations. These issues could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential system compromise. The combination of disabled security controls and unsafe file operations creates an urgent need for remediation, as the application would likely fail a security audit in its current state.\n\n## Key Patterns & Root Causes\n\n1. **Systemic Security Control Disablement**\n   - Critical security features (CSRF, security headers, password encryption) are intentionally disabled\n   - Indicates a development-focused configuration accidentally deployed to production\n   - Creates multiple attack vectors for malicious actors\n\n2. **Unsafe File Operation Patterns**\n   - Unrestricted file uploads without type validation\n   - Path traversal vulnerabilities in multiple components\n   - Missing size limits and unsafe concurrent operations\n   - Could lead to server compromise and data exposure\n\n3. **Inadequate Authentication & Access Control**\n   - Custom authentication implementations lacking proper validation\n   - Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints\n   - Overly permissive resource access\n   - Enables potential credential stuffing and unauthorized access\n\n## Prioritized Action Plan\n\n1. **Immediate Security Control Restoration** (1-2 days)\n   - Enable CSRF protection in `WebSecurityConfig.java`\n   - Replace NoOpPasswordEncoder with BCryptPasswordEncoder\n   - Configure security headers and HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect\n   - Add session timeout and fixation protection\n\n2. **File Operation Security** (3-4 days)\n   - Implement file type validation and size limits in `FileServer.java`\n   - Add path traversal protection in `MvcConfiguration.java`\n   - Create secure file deletion mechanism\n   - Add concurrent operation safety checks\n\n3. **Authentication Hardening** (2-3 days)\n   - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints in `WebSecurityConfig.java`\n   - Add proper validation to `CurrentUser.java`\n   - Configure OAuth2 scopes and validation\n   - Add IP logging for authentication attempts\n\n4. **Access Control Implementation** (2-3 days)\n   - Add proper authorization checks to `/attack` endpoint in `HammerHead.java`\n   - Implement resource handler access controls in `MvcConfiguration.java`\n   - Secure actuator endpoints in `WebSecurityConfig.java`\n   - Add permission checks for file operations\n\n5. **Configuration Security** (1-2 days)\n   - Add input validation for configuration values in `MvcConfiguration.java`\n   - Implement startup validation in `StartWebGoat.java`\n   - Configure Content Security Policy\n   - Add cache control headers for static resources\n\nTotal Estimated Time: 9-14 developer days, recommend parallel implementation where possible.",
