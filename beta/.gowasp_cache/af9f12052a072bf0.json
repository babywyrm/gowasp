  "raw_response": "# Strategic Code Architecture and Security Analysis Report\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe current codebase demonstrates significant architectural complexity with mixed security implementations across multiple modules. While advanced code analysis capabilities exist, there are critical vulnerabilities related to input validation, API key management, and potential over-exposure of sensitive system resources. The primary business risk lies in potential unauthorized access and potential compromise of system integrity through unchecked user interactions and external service dependencies.\n\n## Key Patterns & Root Causes\n\n1. **Inconsistent Security Architecture**\n   - Uneven security implementations across modules\n   - Lack of standardized input validation and sanitization\n   - Varying levels of robust error handling and protection mechanisms\n\n2. **External Service Dependency Risks**\n   - Over-reliance on external AI services without comprehensive interaction safeguards\n   - Potential exposure of sensitive system resources through dynamic prompt generation\n   - Insufficient rate limiting and API interaction controls\n\n3. **Monolithic Code Structure**\n   - Large, multi-responsibility scripts increasing complexity\n   - Reduced maintainability and increased security attack surface\n   - Lack of clear separation of concerns\n\n## Prioritized Action Plan\n\n1. **Implement Uniform Input Validation** (High Priority)\n   - Refactor `dynamic__.py`, `smart__.py`, and `prompts.py`\n   - Standardize input sanitization across all modules\n   - Add comprehensive type and content checking\n\n2. **Secure API Key Management** (High Priority)\n   - Update `dynamic_max_.py` and `smart__.py`\n   - Implement advanced key rotation and encryption mechanisms\n   - Add multi-layer validation for environment variable usage\n\n3. **Modularize Monolithic Scripts** (Medium Priority)\n   - Restructure `smart__.py` into smaller, focused components\n   - Implement clear interface boundaries\n   - Reduce single script's responsibility scope\n\n4. **Enhanced File Processing Security** (Medium Priority)\n   - Update `dynamic__.py` with strict file size and type controls\n   - Implement comprehensive security scanning for file uploads\n   - Add granular extension whitelisting\n\n5. **Rate Limiting and External Service Protection** (Low Priority)\n   - Develop middleware for API interaction control\n   - Implement exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns\n   - Add logging and monitoring for external service calls\n\n6. **Comprehensive Error Handling** (Low Priority)\n   - Standardize error responses across all modules\n   - Implement graceful failure mechanisms\n   - Ensure no sensitive information leakage in error messages",
